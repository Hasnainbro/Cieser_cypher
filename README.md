# Cieser_cypher
Encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher with this simple Python command-line application. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts characters in the alphabet by a fixed number, making it a fun and educational tool for encoding and decoding secret messages.

## Features
* Encode Messages: Transform your plain text message into a cipher text by shifting the characters in the alphabet.
* Decode Messages: Decrypt cipher text messages to reveal the original plain text.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository's directory.

3. Run the application by executing the following command:
       `python caesar_cipher.py`

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the application.

## Usage

1. **Type of Operation**

      * When prompted, type 'encode' to encrypt a message or 'decode' to decrypt a message.

2. **Input Your Message**

      * Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt. The message is not case-sensitive.
3. **Shift Number**

      * Input the shift number to determine the level of encryption or decryption. This number represents how many positions each letter should be shifted in the alphabet.
4. **View Results**

      * The application will display the resulting cipher text or plain text based on your selected operation.
5. **Enjoy Secure Communication**

      * Use this application to send secret messages to friends or simply learn about encryption and decryption.

## Customization

Feel free to customize this application to match your preferences. Here are some ideas:

  * Change the alphabet list to support additional characters or languages.
  * Modify the prompts and messages to better suit your style.
